====================
Memorization project
====================

Exam project for "Advanced Deep Learning in Computer Vision" Spring 2024.
Codebase uses the CheXpert dataset and creates image-text pairs by turning the chexpert-csv data into strings. A stable diffusion pipeline is then trained using CLIP. Following this, in the folder "check_memorization" we investigate the degree 
to which the model has memorized its input data.
Inspiration and some code is from "DETECTING, EXPLAINING, AND MITIGATING MEMORIZATION IN DIFFUSION MODELS" by Wen. et. al. 2024.
